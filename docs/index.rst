EU Login Bundle
===============

A Central Authentication Service bundle for Symfony 4.

The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is an Open-Source single sign-on protocol for the web.
Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials only once.
It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials,
such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.

In order to foster a greater adoption of this bundle, it has been built
with interoperability in mind. It only uses `PHP Standards Recommendations`_ interfaces.

-  `PSR-3`_ for logging,
-  `PSR-4`_ for classes autoloading,
-  `PSR-6`_ for caching,
-  `PSR-7`_ for HTTP messages (requests, responses),
-  `PSR-12`_ for coding standards,
-  `PSR-17`_ for HTTP messages factories,
-  `PSR-18`_ for HTTP client.
